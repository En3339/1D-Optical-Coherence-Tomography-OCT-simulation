# 1D-Optical-Coherence-Tomography-OCT-simulation
Matlab 1D FD-OCT Simulation
This program simulates Michelson Interferometer, which involves a half-and-half beam spliter in the input beam path. The reflection mirror is fixed and the samples is a multi-layer beam reflector with reflection index of a constant num 1(sounds like a mirror). The program simulates the Electric field of scaning and reference path. Finally, using FFT to get A-Scan signal, which is an ideal experiment, and this project is the start of my PhD research topic.
